### Hello and welcome to my page!

I'm a junior full-stack developer with a passion for building clean, efficient, and user-friendly programmes. My projects span Python, HTML & CSS, and Java, each reflecting my journey of growth and continuous learning.

You'll find here well-documented projects with README files explaining the logic behind my work. Clean, well-commented code that prioritises readability and best practices. A mix of personal projects and practical solutions aimed at making technology more accessible.

I'm always exploring new technologies and refining my skills. Feel free to check out my work!

Thanks for stopping by!

Liam
