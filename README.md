### Hello and welcome to my page!
I'm Liam, a 25-year-old Software Engineering student!

I have completed and passed HyperionDev's "Software Engineering Bootcamp". On my Github you will see my projects and be able to read the reasoning and logic behind my projects on their corresponding README pages. I love to use lots of comments to help me learn and to help people understand and follow along with me.

Making things as user-friendly as possible is my goal!

Thanks,

Liam Kavanagh
