### Hello and welcome to my page!
I'm Liam, a 24 year old Software Engineering student!

I have completed and passed HyperionDev's "Software Engineering Bootcamp".
On my Github you will see my projects and be able to read my reasoning and logic behind my projects on their corrosponding README pages.
Making things as user-friendly as possible is my goal!

I am very new to Github, so please be patient & nice! #python

Thanks,

Liam Kavanagh
