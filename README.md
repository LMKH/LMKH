### Hello and welcome to my page!

I am a graduate of HyperionDev's Software Engineering Bootcamp. On my GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects showcasing my skills and growth as a software developer. Each project is accompanied by detailed README pages that explain the reasoning and logic behind my work.

In the past year, I transitioned into web development, building on a diverse skill set honed through hands-on experience and continuous learning.

I am passionate about writing clear, clean and comprehensive comments in my code to facilitate learning and make my projects easy to follow. My primary goal is to create user-friendly solutions that are accessible to all.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub!

Liam
