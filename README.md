### Hello and welcome to my page!
I'm Liam, a 24 year old Software Engineering student!

I have completed and passed HyperionDev's "Software Engineering Bootcamp".
On my Github you will see my projects and be able to read my reasoning and logic behind my projects on their corrosponding README pages.
I love to use lots of comments to help me learn and to help people understand and follow along with me.

Making things as user-friendly as possible is my goal!

In my 'Projects' repository is where you will find my portfolio of work.

Thanks,

Liam Kavanagh
